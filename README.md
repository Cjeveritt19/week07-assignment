I have acheived all the requirements. I did struggle with creating a league table for my site due to not being able to find the right api for it but that is something I can work on in the future. Can I please recieve alot of feedback for this in regards to it as a whole as I think it will help me in the future and I believe this might be some of best work so far. I ecountered some bugs with the posts at the start but that was due to me not implementting the interval so it was just GETting them constantly. I think the only thing that could be better is having a league table but other than that I think this project went really well. I did have to ask Bertie for a bit of help along the way in regards to the api and the infinite server GET request but apart from that I used alot from what I had learnt this week and the previous weeks to make a Full stack application.
